HSANet (handsegmentation and alignment network) is a real-time part-level hand semantic segmentation network built upon the PaddleSeg framework. 

More experimental details and results are available in our paper (Under review)

The repository for the PaddleSeg project is located at:
https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleSeg

The method for using the pretrained weights of HSANet can be found in the official PaddleSeg documentation: https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleSeg/blob/release/2.10/docs/model_export_en.md

Should you encounter any issues when using the provided model weights, please open an issue. We are more than happy to offer our assistance.
