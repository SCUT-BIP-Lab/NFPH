HSANet (handsegmentation and alignment network) is a real-time part-level hand semantic segmentation network built upon the PaddleSeg framework. 

More experimental details and results are available in our paper (Under review)

The repository for the PaddleSeg project is located at:
https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleSeg

The method for loading the pretrained weights of HSANet can be found in the official PaddleSeg documentation: https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleSeg/blob/release/2.10/docs/model_export_en.md

If you encounter any issues while using the model weights we provided, please leave an issue.
