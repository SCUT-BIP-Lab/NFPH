- 🔒 FPHandNet (Multi-modal Authentication Framework)
- 📊 SCUT NFPH v1/v2 Databases

## 📚 SCUT Normalized-Full-Palmar-Hand Databases
### Key Features
✅ ​**157,500 hand biometric images**  
✅ Three data types per subject:  
　▸ Full hand images  
　▸ Semantic masks  
　▸ Individual biometric traits (palmprint/vein/etc.)  

### Request

**SCUT_NFPH_v1** and **SCUT_NFPH_v2** are publicly available (free of charge) to the research community. Unfortunately, due to privacy reasons, we cannot provide the database for commercial use.
