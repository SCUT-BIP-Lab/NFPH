# FPHandNet

FPHandNet supports multiple mainstream deep feature extraction backbones. In this repository, we specifically provide an open-source implementation using [FasterNet-T1](https://github.com/JierunChen/FasterNet) as an example.

The main ideas and experimental results are detailed in our paper(Under review)

## Environment

Recommended environment and dependencies (adjust versions as needed):

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch >= 1.0
- CUDA 10.2 / 11.x (if using GPU)
- torchvision, numpy, opencv-python, tqdm, math, etc.


## Pretrained Weights

Original FasterNet-T1 pretrained weights are from https://github.com/JierunChen/FasterNet, licensed under MIT. If special restrictions apply, please follow the original license.
