# FPHandNet

FPHandNet supports multiple mainstream deep feature extraction backbones. In this repository, we specifically provide an open-source implementation using [FasterNet-T1](https://github.com/JierunChen/FasterNet) as an example.

The main ideas and experimental results are detailed in our paper(Under review)

## Environment

Recommended environment and dependencies (adjust versions as needed):

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch >= 1.0
- CUDA 10.2 / 11.x (if using GPU)
- torchvision, numpy, opencv-python, tqdm, math, etc.


## Pretrained Weights

Original FasterNet-T1 pretrained weights are from https://github.com/JierunChen/FasterNet, licensed under MIT. If special restrictions apply, please follow the original license.


This open-source release includes only the network architecture modifications proposed in our work, intended solely for academic research and communication. The complete training framework developed by our group involves ongoing and unpublished research, and therefore cannot be released at this time. However, the provided network structure can be easily integrated into mainstream training frameworks. If you encounter any issues or need assistance during integration, please feel free to contact the authors. Thank you for your understanding and support!
